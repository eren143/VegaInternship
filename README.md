Predictive ML models that detects faulty devices of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Each network device has signal properties such as interference, disconnection...
The data sets were binned and trained to predict if a device with the given properties is faulty or not. I completed this project in my summer internship at VEGA networks.
Linear regression, Multiple regression and Isotonic regression were used. Python libraries such as SKlearn, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib were used.
